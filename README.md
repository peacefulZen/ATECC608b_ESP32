This is a functioning Arduino implementation of Microchip's cryptoauthlib (v3.7.0).

If you are selling IoT devices and interested in making your stuff hackproof - the ATECC608B is a very cost effective solution for this (under $2 per board). Of course, integrating this chip with Arduino is a nightmare for most developers.

This solution works and can be used to figure out configuring the chip and then encrypting/decrypting with the chip. **Not much else to say here except that when it runs in your instance of PlatformIO, just type in 'y' (without the parenthesis) to kick things off.**
